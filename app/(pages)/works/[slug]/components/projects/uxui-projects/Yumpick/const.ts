    description:
      "In the research phase, I felt overwhelmed by the range of issues uncovered through surveys, interviews, and competitive analysis, so many that I wondered how to tackle them all in one app. To regain focus, I identified the highest-impact problems and set clear scope boundaries, tackling core features first. This iterative approach allowed me to refine Yumpick into a lean prototype that truly addresses user pain points. Ultimately, I learned that defining a manageable scope and centering every decision on real user needs are essential to creating meaningful, user-focused solutions.",
