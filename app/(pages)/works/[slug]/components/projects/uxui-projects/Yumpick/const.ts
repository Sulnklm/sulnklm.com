  BACKGROUND: {
    HEADING: "Why This Project?",
    TITLE: "Eliminating App-Hopping",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "I began structuring this project after realizing how much time I spent switching between apps to find the right restaurant. Through research, I found that many others shared this frustration. I wanted to build a simpler way for people to discover restaurants and access all the necessary information in one place.",
  },
  USER_RESEARCH: {
    HEADING: "How Users Discover",
    USER_SURVEY: {
      DESCRIPTION:
        "To ensure this project would truly meet the needs of its users, I wanted to go beyond just my own experience and understand how other people approach restaurant discovery. So, I first conducted a user survey & interview to gather general insights on which apps users primarily rely on for restaurant discovery and what factors they consider most important when choosing a restaurant. One key finding was that users strongly prefer platforms with social media‚Äìlike features for exploring restaurants!",
      TITLE: "Visual-First Apps Lead the Pack in Restaurant Discovery",
      SURVEY1_HEADING:
        "Which platforms or apps do you use to explore restaurants?",
    },
  },
  COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS: {
    HEADING: "What‚Äôs Missing in Other Apps?",
    IMG: {
      SRC: "/images/projects/yumpick/competitor-analysis/yumpick-competitor1.png",
      ALT: "Competitor Analysis Image",
    },
    TITLE: "No App Delivers Visuals and Details Simultaneously",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "To identify where existing apps fell short, I analyzed Instagram, Yelp, Beli, and Google Maps by evaluating their social-media style browsing, detailed reviews, local recommendations, and location data. I discovered that no platform offers immersive visual discovery alongside comprehensive menu and reservation details at the same time. This clear gap became the project‚Äôs guiding focus: uniting rich, photo-driven exploration with accurate, up-to-date information in one seamless experience.",
  },

  DESIGN_PROCESS: {
    HEADING: "Bringing Ideas to Life",
    STEP1: {
      TITLE: "Laying the Foundations",
      DESCRIPTION: "Before diving into full UI design, I mapped out the information architecture and rough wireframe sketches to ensure the app‚Äôs structure would meet real user needs. This groundwork let me validate key workflows and flow into higher-fidelity mockups with confidence.",

          ALT: "Low Fidelity Wireframes Image",
        },
      }
    },
    STEP2: {
      TITLE: "Crafting a Consistent Visual Framework",
      DESCRIPTION:"After validating the app‚Äôs structure, I translated core user flows into medium-fidelity wireframes, iterating on layouts, interactions, and visual hierarchy to balance clarity and functionality. I also established a cohesive design system by defining typography, color palette, components, and spacing guidelines to ensure consistency across screens and speed up future iterations.",

        },
      }
    },
    STEP3: {
      TITLE: "From Mockups to Interactive Prototype",
      DESCRIPTION:"Building on the design system, I crafted polished high-fidelity mockups that showcase finalized UI elements, including typography, color palette, and components. I then assembled an interactive prototype with clickable flows to simulate key user journeys. Usability tests on this prototype revealed minor tweaks needed for smoother interactions, ensuring the final design delivers a seamless, intuitive experience.",

  REFLECTION: {
    TITLE: "Focusing on Core Needs",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "In the research phase, I felt overwhelmed by the range of issues uncovered through surveys, interviews, and competitive analysis, so many that I wondered how to tackle them all in one app. To regain focus, I identified the highest-impact problems and set clear scope boundaries, tackling core features first. This iterative approach allowed me to refine Yumpick into a lean prototype that truly addresses user pain points. Ultimately, I learned that defining a manageable scope and centering every decision on real user needs are essential to creating meaningful, user-focused solutions.",
  },
  DEFINING: {
    HEADING: "What Users Need",
    TITLE: "From Insights to Requirements",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "To ensure that the app addresses real user needs, I created a user experience framework that includes persona development, journey mapping, and a flow chart to guide the design process. I chose a content creator as my persona, representing one of the target audiences of trendy food explorers struggling with using multiple platforms for restaurant discovery. Through this framework, I gained clear insights into what users truly need from the app. From these insights, I distilled three core requirements: immersive visual discovery, comprehensive restaurant information, and a user-friendly, intuitive interface.",
