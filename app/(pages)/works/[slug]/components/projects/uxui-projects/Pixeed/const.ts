  BACKGROUND: {
    HEADING: "Why This Project?",
    TITLE: "From Messy Feedback to Clear Action",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "While working on SaaS and freelance projects, my team often struggled with scattered feedback and lengthy user testing videos. Instead of accepting that messiness as normal, I wanted to rethink the workflow not just as a designer, but as someone who values clarity, context, and collaboration. This project wasn‚Äôt about finding a perfect solution but about exploring a more thoughtful, transparent, and collaborative way of working.",

  PROBLEM: {

    HEADING: "Real-World Frustration",
    TITLE: "Where things often get messy",
    DESCRIPTION: {
      1: "In small teams, client feedback often plays a key role in QA. But the way feedback comes in, whether through vague videos, scattered emails, or out-of-sync DMs, creates real friction.",
      2: "üåÄ Without context, feedback gets misunderstood or misprioritized.",
      3: "üîÅ Teams unknowingly revisit the same issue, unsure if it is new, resolved, or still in development.",
      4: "üí¨ Designers and developers repeat the same explanations because past decisions were not visible.",
      5: "The result? Duplicate tickets, wasted time, and broken focus for both the team and the client. This inefficiency did not come from laziness. It came from a lack of visibility. It does not just slow down the team, it breaks the loop.",

    TITLE: "Video-first vs. Pin-on-page: What‚Äôs the Difference?",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "Tools like Marker.io and BugHerd focus on pin-on-page annotations. This is perfect for quick visual fixes, copy tweaks, or spotting small UI glitches. You click directly on the page, leave a note, and the team knows exactly where to look. This works well for simple, isolated changes.",
    DESCRIPTION2:
      "However, when a project involves complex user flows, multi-step processes, or interactions across multiple screens, single-point annotations fall short. In these cases, video feedback becomes a better solution, as it captures the entire journey in context and helps teams understand not just where an issue occurs, but how the user got there.",

    STEP1: {
      TITLE: "Step 1: Structuring the Experience",
      DESCRIPTION:
        "Before diving into the complete design phase, I focused on visualizing the product‚Äôs overall structure to ensure a clear foundation. I started by building the information architecture (IA), mapping both the team and client-side user flows to understand every interaction point. This was followed by wireframe sketches that laid out the core layouts and interactions, providing a blueprint for the detailed design work ahead.",

    },
    STEP2: {
      TITLE: "Step 2: Design System & Figma Setup",
      DESCRIPTION:
        "To ensure visual consistency, I developed a design system in Figma that defined typography, color palettes, and reusable UI components. This shared system enabled both the client and team to work within a unified, structured environment, reducing design debt and accelerating iteration. It also established a solid foundation for creating high-fidelity wireframes.",

      TITLE: "Step3: High-Fidelity Wireframes and Interactive Prototypes",
      DESCRIPTION:
        "Building on the initial Information Architecture and sketches, I developed high-fidelity wireframes for both the team and client views, refining visual details and layout. Guided by the user flows, I then created interactive prototypes to simulate the full experience and test key interactions.",

  REFLECTION: {
    TITLE: "Designing for the Unseen Frustrations",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "This project was a reminder that meaningful innovation doesn‚Äôt always come from solving grand, complex problems. Sometimes, it‚Äôs about addressing the everyday frictions everyone has grown used to tolerating. By stripping away unnecessary steps and rethinking how feedback is shared and acted on, I learned the value of designing for simplicity without sacrificing depth. The process reinforced that when you make the obvious easy, you free up time and energy for the truly challenging work. Moving forward, I‚Äôll continue to seek opportunities to remove these hidden inefficiencies so teams can focus on creating, not troubleshooting.",
