    TITLE: "From Messy Feedback to Clear Action",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "While working on SaaS and freelance projects, I often struggled with scattered client feedback, long user testing videos, and tickets that lacked context. Important details were buried in lengthy recordings, making it hard for teams to act quickly and confidently. Pixeed was created to turn messy video feedback into clear, actionable insights by automatically breaking it into chapters, generating tickets with the right context, and helping teams collaborate with clarity from the start.",

    DESCRIPTION: {
      1: "In small teams, client feedback often plays a key role in QA. But the way feedback comes in, whether through vague videos, scattered emails, or out-of-sync DMs, creates real friction.",
      2: "üåÄ Without context, feedback gets misunderstood or misprioritized.",
      3: "üîÅ Teams unknowingly revisit the same issue, unsure if it is new, resolved, or still in development.",
      4: "üí¨ Designers and developers repeat the same explanations because past decisions were not visible.",
      5: "The result? Duplicate tickets, wasted time, and broken focus for both the team and the client. This inefficiency did not come from laziness. It came from a lack of visibility. It does not just slow down the team, it breaks the loop.",

    TITLE: "Video-first vs. Pin-on-page: What‚Äôs the Difference?",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "Tools like Marker.io and BugHerd focus on pin-on-page annotations. This is perfect for quick visual fixes, copy tweaks, or spotting small UI glitches. You click directly on the page, leave a note, and the team knows exactly where to look. This works well for simple, isolated changes.",
      DESCRIPTION2:
      "However, when a project involves complex user flows, multi-step processes, or interactions across multiple screens, single-point annotations fall short. In these cases, video feedback becomes a better solution, as it captures the entire journey in context and helps teams understand not just where an issue occurs, but how the user got there.",
